# Level Supermind Assignment
The following are the steps, kindly check:
1. I have made 2 tests using appium and java, one is the valid login test and invalid login test.
2. These 2 tests are about the login functionality, the login valid will check if the login is valid and successfull and check if the element which
should be present on the homescreen is present or not, that is the assertion here.
3. The invalid login will check for a toast message which pops up after a invalid login, the assertion would be to check if this toast message is popping up or not.
